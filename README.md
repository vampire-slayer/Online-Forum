# Online-Forum
A forum created using MySQL and PHP that allows users to register, sign in, sign out, create categories and create topics in these categories which users can discuss by replying to the topics. I created it during my first semester in IIIT Allahabad.

## How to run it
Since the forum has been created using PHP and MySQL, it needs to be hosted first. For testing purposes, it can be hosted locally. I mostly use XAMPP to host the forum locally.

Execute the commands given in the file 'schema.sql' inside the 'forum' folder on MySQL.

Modify the 'connect.php' file inside the 'forum' folder based on the host and MySQL login credentials on your machine.

Once you are done with the above steps, run the 'index.php' file inside the 'forum' folder, this is the forum homepage.
